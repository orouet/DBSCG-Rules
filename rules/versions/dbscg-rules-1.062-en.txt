8. Activating and Resolving Skills

8-1. Skill
8-1-1. A skill refers to an order generated from card text and its cost.
8-1-2. Skills can be divided into 3 categories: [Activate], [Permanent], and [Auto].
8-1-3. [Activate] skills are skills that a player can activate by paying the skill cost and fulfilling its conditions when granted a free timing.
8-1-3-1. [Activate] skills are described on card text in the following formats: “[Activate: Main] skill cost: effect” or [Activate: Battle] skill cost: effect.” The text before the colon is the skill cost necessary to activate the [Activate] skill, and the following text is the actual effect of the text.
8-1-3-1-1. Some [Activate] skills of Battle Cards and Leader Cards do not have skill cost. Those skills can be activated by declaring them.
8-1-3-1-2. Some [Activate] skills of Extra Cards do not have skill costs. Those skills can be activated by paying the Extra Card’s energy cost. Such skills are described on card text in the following formats: “[Activate: Main] effect” or “[Activate: Battle] effect.”
8-1-4. [Permanent] skills are skills that constantly have some kind of effect on gameplay while they are active.
8-1-4-1. 8-1-4-2. [Permanent] skills are described on card text in the following format: “[Permanent] (effect).”
8-1-4-2. If some effect renders a certain target/object of a [Permanent] skills invalid of being a target/object of that skill, it cannot become the target/object of that same [permanent] skill for the duration of the turn.
8-1-5. An [Auto] skill automatically activates when the event specified by the skill occurs during the game.
8-1-5-1. [Auto] skills are described on card text in the following formats: “[Auto] When (condition) do (effect)” or “[Auto] At the beginning of the (phase or step), do (effect)” or “[Auto] At the end of the (phase or step), do (effect).” The (condition) and (phase or step) parts are called trigger conditions.

8-2. Effects
8-2-1. Effects are the actual details of the orders given to players by skills.
8-2-2. Effects can be divided into immediate effects, continuous effects, and replacement effects.
8-2-2-1. The directions of immediate effects are carried out and end during the resolution of the effect. The effects of skills such as “Draw 1 card” or “Place this card in the Drop Area” are immediate effects.
8-2-2-2. Continuous effects last for a specific amount of time (including effects that don’t specify how long, such as “during the game” effects) during the game. The effects of skills such as “During the battle, this card gains +5000 power” are continuous effects.
8-2-2-3. Replacement effects replace certain events during the game with the event specified in the effect.
8-2-2-3-1. The effect of a skill directing to “When doing A, do B instead” is a replacement effect.

8-3. Valid and Negated Skills
8-3-1. Some effect may render other specific effects valid or invalid. In such an occasion, follow the procedure below.
8-3-2. If an effect specifies that some effect is partially or totally negated under specific conditions, the negated effect (under those conditions) is recognized as a skill but their effects cannot be activated. If the negated effect requests a choice, the choice itself is not made.
8-3-3. If some effect is specified as partially or totally valid under specific conditions, that part is negated if the specific conditions are not fulfilled.

8-4. Skill Cost
8-4-1. An [Activate] skill may have certain actions specified before a colon. Those actions are called skill costs.
8-4-2. “To pay the skill cost” means to “carry out the action specified in the skill cost.”
8-4-2-1. If a single skill cost includes multiple actions, carry them out from the beginning of the text.
8-4-2-2. If a player cannot pay a part or all of a skill cost, that means the player cannot pay the cost at all.
8-4-2-3. Some skill costs are described with symbols such as ①. This means to choose and switch that many of your energy to Rest Mode.
8-4-2-4. Some skill costs are described with colored spheres. This means to choose and switch that many of your energy of that color to Rest Mode.

8-5. Activating and Resolving
8-5-1. [Activate], [Auto], [Awaken], and cards in a player’s hand are resolved by activating them, triggering their effects. [Permanent] skills do not activate; their effects are constantly active.
8-5-2. Activate skills following the procedure below.
8-5-2-1. The player specifies which skill they wish to activate. If they wish to activate the skill of a card in their hand, they reveal that card.
8-5-2-2. If there is a necessary skill cost, determine that cost and they pay it entirely.
8-5-2-2-1. When activating Extra Card skills, they determine the Extra Card’s cost and pay it.
8-5-2-3. The skill is activated.
8-5-2-4. A counter timing occurs.
8-5-2-5. Resolve the skill.
8-5-2-5-1. If a player activated an Extra Card skill, place the card in the Drop Area and carry out the skill’s effect.
8-5-2-5-2. If a player activated the [Activate] or [Auto] of a card in the Leader Area, Battle Area, or Combo Area, carry out the skill’s effect.
8-5-2-6. A counter timing occurs.
8-5-3. If the skill describes to “choose... ” choose the indicated target card or player (target) when required to do so during the resolution of the skill.
8-5-3-1. If the number of targets a player chooses is specified, they must choose as close a number to that number as possible. They cannot purposefully choose fewer targets than the specified number.
8-5-3-2. If the number is specified as “up to...” or “...or less,” they can select any number of targets from 0 to the specified number.
8-5-3-3. If the number of targets is specified, but some of the targets cannot be chosen, the player chooses as many targets as possible and resolves the specified effect against them.
8-5-3-4. If the number of targets is specified, but none of the targets can be chosen, no targets are chosen. All effects concerning those targets are ignored.
8-5-3-5. If the specified target is a card in a secret area, and if the choice requires information of the card, players cannot guarantee that the target is a card that meets the required conditions. Thus a player can decide not to choose a card from a secret area, even if it may fulfill the conditions.
8-5-3-6. If the text does not specify a target, the following rules apply: if the effect concerns a card, it is targeting the source of the effect, or if the effect concerns a player it is targeting the master of the effect.
8-5-3-7. When choosing a card from a deck, search while viewing the front face of the deck, then select the specified card from within.
8-5-4. Unless specified otherwise, if the text refers to a “Battle Card,” it’s referring to a Battle Card in the Battle Area.
8-5-5. If the text refers to an “Energy Card,” it’s referring to a card placed in the Energy Area.
8-5-6. If the text refers to “Life,” it’s referring to a card placed in the Life Area.

8-6. Resolving [Auto] Skills
8-6-1. [Auto] skills are skills that automatically activate at the checkpoint which occurs when a specific trigger condition occurs.
8-6-2. When the trigger condition of an [Auto] skill is fulfilled, that [Auto] skill is made pending.
8-6-3. Unless specified otherwise, if the trigger condition of a [Auto] skill is fulfilled multiple times, that [Auto] skill is made pending that many times.
8-6-4. When a checkpoint occurs, a player being requested to activate an [Auto] skill chooses 1 pending [Auto] which they are the master of and activates it. After resolving the activated skill, decrease the number of those pending [Auto] skills (of that skill) by 1.
8-6-4-1. If for some reason the chosen pending [Auto] skill cannot be chosen, cancel 1 of those pending [Auto] skills (of that skill).
8-6-5. There are [Auto] skills for which the trigger condition is a card moving areas. This is called an area movement trigger.
8-6-5-1. An [Auto] skill activated by an area movement trigger may request information of the card that triggered the skill. Is such an occasion, track the information following the procedure below.
8-6-5-1-1. If an [Auto] skill triggered by the movement of a card/cards from an open area to a secret area (or vice versa) requests information of the card, use the information of the card as it was/is in the open area.
8-6-5-1-2. If an [Auto] skill triggered by the movement of a card/cards in the Battle Area to any other area or an [Auto] skill concerning the inter-player area movement requests information of the card, use the information of the card as it was/is in the Battle Area.
8-6-5-1-3. If an [Auto] skill (other than those described in 8-6-5-1-2) triggered by the movement of a card/cards from an open area to an open area requests information of the card, use the information of the card as it is in the new area.
8-6-6. An [Auto] may have a trigger condition of not a specific event but the fulfillment of a certain condition (example: When there are no cards in a player’s hand...). These kinds of conditions are called situation triggers.
8-6-6-1. A situation trigger is made pending (only once) when the specified situation occurs. After this [Auto] skill is resolved, if the trigger condition is to be fulfilled once again, the skill too is put into pending once again unless specified otherwise.
8-6-7. If a pending [Auto] skill activates, yet the card with that skill is no longer in the same area, or if the skill has been negated, the player must still resolve that [Auto] skill. However, if the effect of that [Auto] skill has become impossible to carry out due to the change of areas, the effect fails to resolve.

8-7. Processing Immediate Effects
8-7-1. If a player is requested to carry out an immediate effect, they must carry out the specified action at once.

8-8. Processing Continuous Effects
8-8-1. When information of a card is requested while some continuous effect is active, follow the procedure below to apply the continuous effect to that information.
8-8-1-1. The information specified on a card itself will always be base reference for information.
8-8-1-2. Next, apply all continuous effects except for effects that rewrite numerical information.
8-8-1-3. Then, apply all continuous effects which rewrite numerical information.
8-8-1-4. All continuous effects except for those generated by [Permanent] skills are not applied to cards that have moved to different areas from the Leader Area or Battle Area after the effect was resolved.
8-8-1-5. Continuous effects that rewrite the information of cards in specific areas are applied immediately as cards enter that area.
8-8-1-5-1. An [Auto] skill triggered by a card with specific information entering an area checks the said information after any continuous effects are applied to the area.

8-9. Processing Replacement Effects
8-9-1. If a replacement effect is active, the specified event is not processed when it occurs, and the event specified by the replacement effect is processed instead.
8-9-1-1. Thus, the original event is treated as if it never happened.
8-9-2. If there are multiple replacement effects concerning a single event, the player affected by the event decides which replacement effect to activate.
8-9-2-1. If cards or skills are the subject of the replacement, the master of those cards or skills makes the choice.
8-9-2-2. If actions during the game are the subject of the replacement, the player carrying out action or the master of the target card of the action makes the choice.
8-9-2-3. Each replacement effect can only be applied once for the same subject event.
8-9-3. If the replacement effect is a voluntary replacement effect (when X, you can do X instead. If so, do X), and a player is unable to make that choice, they cannot apply the replacement effect.
8-10. The Final Information of a Card
8-10-1. If some effect is referring to a specific card’s information or state, and if the card is moving from one area to another during the processing of the effect, the effect refers to the card’s information as it is in the final area to which it moved.

9-4-2. When a new card is placed on an existing card either in the Battle Area or Leader Area, continuous effects regarding additions/subtractions to the card’s power and position of the existing card are carried over to the card placed on top of it.
9-5. Processing when a Battle Card’s power drops to 0 or below.
9-5-1. Confirmative rules processing is used when a Battle Card’s power drops to 0 or below.
9-5-2. If a Battle Card’s power drops to 0 or below, that card is KO-ed.
9-5-2-1. After an effect causes a card’s power to change, if that Battle Card’s power drops to 0 or below and is KO-ed as a result of rules processing dictating Battle Cards be KO-ed when their power drops to 0 or below, that Battle Card is considered to have been KO-ed by that effect.
